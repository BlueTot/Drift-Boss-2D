DRIFT BOSS 2D: A MODDED REMAKE OF DRIFT BOSS
--------------------------------------------

Welcome to Drift Boss 2D!

This game is a modded remake of the mathplayground.com game drift boss, but in 2 dimensions only.

If you don't know how to play the game, check out instructions.txt in the 'info' file attached.

*To play the game, download the zip file in the latest version, unzip it and drag them into the same directory in your IDE and press the run button. 
*Progress is automatically stored in the gamedata.json file. When you quit the game, your progress will be updated to the file

* LATEST update v1.1.0 does NOT come with an upgrade module so no progress is transferred from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0

THE LATEST UPDATE (v1.1.0) comes with:
  - splitting of the main code file into 6 subfiles and 1 main file
  - introduction of health and mana
  - introduction of 5 reforges
  - game data format changed from .csv to .json
  - tweaks and balancing

FUTURE IDEAS/UPDATES:
  - update 1.2: movement changes
  
  - other ideas include:
    - essence to upgrade car levels (not coins)
    - 5 new maps (4 normal maps and 1 endgame boss)
    - elemental damage and elemental defense
